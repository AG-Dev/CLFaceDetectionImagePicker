# CLFaceDetectionImagePicker (NOT OPENCV!!!)

CLFaceDetectionImagePicker is a clean and so-easy-to-use ImagePicker meant to do live face detection. 
It will draw a square if any face is detected in the camera as below and take photo automatically if the face detection is passed.

## Installation
* Drag the `CLFaceDetectionImagePickerSourceCode` folder into your project.


## Demo Usage

**Please download all of the files in the repo and run it directly to have a look.**

**Use CLFaceDetectionImagePicker wisely! Lights in front of the camera will affect the accuracy of face detection.**


## Initialize 
Using CLFaceDetectionImagePicker in your app will usually look as simple as this :


```objective-c

_imagePickerViewController = [CLFaceDetectionImagePickerViewController new];
_imagePickerViewController.delegate = self;

//Show the ImagePicker
[self presentViewController:self.imagePickerViewController animated:YES completion:nil];

```

## Delegate

After the imagePicker take photo or dismiss without detecting any face, it will fire CLFaceDetectionImagePickerDidDismiss delegate function as below which you need to apply

```objective-c
//After getting data callback
-(void)CLFaceDetectionImagePickerDidDismiss:(NSData *)data blnSuccess:(BOOL)blnSuccess
{
self.statusInfo.text = (blnSuccess)?@"Success":@"Failed";

if(data){
self.imageView.image = [UIImage imageWithData:data];
self.imageView.hidden = NO;
}else{
self.imageView.hidden = YES;
}
}
```

## Customisation

**Please be aware customisation delegate function is optional, if u do not apply it, it will just fire the default value.

Using CLFaceDetectionImagePickerDelegate to customise the behaviour

Following customisation key is allowed

###CLTotalDetectCountDownSecond;    //Total length of waiting period for face detection - Default: 20###
###CLFaceDetectionSquareImageName;  //Image name for the face detection square image    - Default: CameraSquare###
###CLFaceDetectionTimes;            //Continually detecting face times, this will be helpful to make sure the people are not shaking his head by purpose       - Default: 5###
###CLCameraPosition;                //Choose which camera you want to use, CLCaptureDevicePositionBack or CLCaptureDevicePositionFront  -Default: CLCaptureDevicePositionFront###


You need to fire below delegate function to apply your customisation
```objective-c

// Optional!!! Set The Face Detection Behavior Attributes
-(NSDictionary *)faceDetectionBehaviorAttributes
{
return @{
CLFaceDetectionTimes : @10,                 //Total times for capture clear detected face images to prevent user shake their heads in purpose
CLFaceDetectionSquareImageName : @"CameraSqaure", //Different FaceDetection Square Image. try to use "squarePNG" for different image
CLTotalDetectCountDownSecond : @12,        //Total waiting time, after this value, the picker will auto closed no matter it get face detected or not.
CLCameraPosition : [NSNumber numberWithInteger:CLCaptureDevicePositionFront] //Which camera try to use, Front or back.  CLCaptureDevicePositionBack or CLCaptureDevicePositionFront
};
}

```
